# Bootstrap JS Exercises

### Basic

1. Create a new project called `bootstrap-js` and create an index.html file inside it. Add bootstrap and jquery to your index.html using a CDN (content delivery network).
1. A jumbotron with a container inside it containing a header 1 welcome message.
1. Below the jumbotron add a default responsive bootstrap navbar.
1. In your navbar add a link called 'login' that reveals a login modal (email, password, login button) (can you make it a narrow modal?)
1. Below the navbar add a container div and inside that add a bootstrap tabs component.
1. Name one tab "thumbnails" and use a bootstrap thumbnail component with an image from placehold.it and a title and a body. Add 7 thumbnails so that you have to scroll down below the navbar.
1. Name the second tab "list items" and use the bootstrap list item group component. Can you make the list items links?

### Stretch

1. Add an affix to your navbar so when you scroll past the jumbotron the navbar sticks to the top of the screen.
1. Make another modal triggered from a "Contact Us" link.
