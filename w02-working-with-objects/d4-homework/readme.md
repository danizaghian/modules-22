#Thursday Homework!

##Read/Skim some of <a href="https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/es5">AirBnB's JavaScript Style Guide</a>
- Spend aabout an hour looking at this.
- Use any extra time you have to review concepts we covered so far this week.

###Why?
- AirBnB's style guide is very well fleshed out. It is also open source. This is why we picked it.
- Why look at a style guide?
  - You are going to be looking at a lot of basic JavaScript patterns! Some will be review, some will be new.
  - Its a great thing to look at LOTS of code. It will make you more familliar with the patterns.

###Things to think about:
- What is the point of having a style guide for a company?
- What do you think about AirBnB's rules?
  - Are they arbitrary choices for consistency only?
  - Or do you think some of these rules have deeper reasons?
  - You don't need to know the answer to these questions, it's just something to think about.
- Do you have any intuitive feelings, either positiv or negative about these rules? If not, in time you will form your own oppinions about this sort of thing.

## Submission

1. None tonight.

## Bonus Reading:

1. <a href="https://medium.com/misc-misc/review-sandi-metz-s-poodr-ch-1-4-wip-d4daac417665">This </a>blog about what a non-ruby programmer learned from POODR. It's a bit abstract for you now, but will help reinforce the ideas behind OOP.
