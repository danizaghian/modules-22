0. As a warmup, try to output the following values:
    * the name of the course
    * the first student's id and full name
    * the number of students in the class
    * a list of github usernames

1. Create a function `buildGithubLink` that transforms a single student's info into an html string, with the following format:

	```
	<a href="https://github.com/torvalds">Linus Torvalds</a>
	```

2. Using the function you just built, create a function called `renderGithubLinks` that takes an array of students and adds their github links to the page.

Extra points if you use built-in Array methods like `forEach`, `map`, and `join` and only insert into the DOM once.
