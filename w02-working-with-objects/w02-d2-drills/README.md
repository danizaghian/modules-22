#First Draft of my notes.

## Solutions project posted. Plan to reverse engineer some exercise

```
// Tuesday Lab: JS built in Objects: Math, Date, etc.(Ben, Matt)
// Show on Mozilla Developer Network:
// new Date(), new Array(), Math.round(), String()
//
// Why can you create new Date, Array and String but not Math object?
// use typeof to explain
//
// there will be a starter project in the exercise folder with explicit instructions
// showing how to build the project in the solutions folder
```
