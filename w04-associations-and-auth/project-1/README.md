# ![](https://ga-dash.s3.amazonaws.com/production/assets/logo-9f88ae6c9c3871690e33280fcf557f33.png) SF WDI 22/23 - Project One


## DESCRIPTION

It's time to put everything that you've learned in the past month together! For the first project you will use your knowledge of front and back-end web development to produce an awesome web application that can be used by friends, family or any of the other billions of people who use the Internet. The type of web application you create is your choice.

**The objective of this project is to:**

* Apply the skills you've learned by building a web application from the ground up.
* Demonstrate mastery of topics covered during this course so far.

You will each need to turn in an individual project, but you will move faster and learn more if you take time to work together and pair program with other students.

## PLANNING & DELIVERABLES

### Project plan deliverables:

*You must review the following with your instructional team BEFORE you start to code.*

* **Scope.** What are you planning to build? What do you reasonably think you can implement in the time period?
* **User stories.** What features will your app have? Set up your project and user stories in [Trello](https://trello.com).
* **Wireframes.** Sketch out what each of your pages will look like and how they will work.
* **Object Models.** Draw out the model associations for your project in an entity relationship diagram (ERD).
* **Milestones.** Outline milestones/sprints to approach the implementation iteratively.


### Completed project deliverables:

* Link to Heroku hosted project, with core and flex technical requirements complete
* Link to source code on GitHub
* A `README` with the following:
  * `Description`: A paragraph-long elevator pitch of your project
  * Another Link to project hosted on Heroku
  * Wireframes
  * `User Stories`, `Site Flow`, or equivalent
  * An Entity Relationship Diagram
  * APIs used
  * Libraries used
  * Wishlist / Future Development

## TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

### Core Technical Requirements 

**Your app should have all of the following:**

* **Express API** Implement a server-side JSON API with Express.
* **RESTful Routes** Design the routes in a <a href="http://restfulrouting.com/mappings/resources" target="_blank">RESTful</a> manner.
* **MongoDB** Persist data with at least two models in a Mongo Database.
* **AJAX** Leverage your server-side Express API to fetch JSON data asynchronously to the client-side.
* **jQuery** Use jQuery to manipulate the DOM and listen for events on the client-side.
* **Server-Side HTML Templating** Render your HTML views with data using EJS templating.
* **Data Validation** Validate data by handling incorrect inputs during sign up, such as unique email addresses and minimum password lengths.
* **Visual Design** Use Bootstrap to kick-start your UI and UX.
* **Heroku** Deploy your app to Heroku.
	* Ensure no app secrets are exposed. __Do not commit secret keys to Github!__

### Flex Technical Requirements

**Your app should have 3 of the 5 following options:**
* **External API** Use an external API to integrate rich data into your app.
* **Model Relationship** Create a one-to-many or many-to-many relationship between two models using either embedded or referenced data.
* **Authentication** Enable users to sign up, log in, and log out. (Note: This covers the core sessions or cookies requirement.)

## Ideas for Further Exploration

If you want to push yourself and learn something new, optionally consider doing some of the following with your app. *Please talk to an instructor* beforehand.

* **Search** Build a form that allows users to search your data based on keywords.
* **Authorization** Create and implement rules that prevent users from seeing/editing/deleting content that belongs to other users. Start with one rule; the specifics are up to you. For example, a good challenge could be saying users cannot delete a post (or other resource) if it is not theirs.  (Note: This requires authentication.)
* **Testing** Write request tests for each of your app's API routes that at least check the response status code. 
* **Email** Send emails with express-mailer.
* **Payments** Add payments with stripe.com.
* **Web-Scraping** Use a web-scraper to collect data from a website that doesn't have an API. Example technologies include <a href="http://casperjs.org" target="_blank">Casper</a> or <a href="https://www.kimonolabs.com" target="_blank">Kimono</a>.
* **Web Sockets** Create an open, real-time connection between your server and client (e.g. live chatting). Check out <a href="http://socket.io/" target="_blank">Socket.io</a> if you're interested in web sockets.
* **Client-side HTML Templating**  Refactor your client side to use a templating library like Mustache, underscore's `_.template`, or another. 
* **Whatever else you can think of!**

## DEADLINES

* **Thursday, October 22nd by 12:30pm** - **REQUIRED**:  Submit your project proposal to an instructor and make a Kaban board for it using Trello. Before beginning work on your project, your project idea and the scope of your project must be checked-off by an instructor. You will need the following for an instructor check-off:
    * Wireframes (simple/hand drawn are great)
    * User narratives / user stories ("Users can create a meal with various foods." or "As a SpaceBook user looking for new friends, I want to be able to update my location to my current planet.")
    * Models and database relationship design (ERD)
    * Proof of feasibility for any external APIs you are using - show us that you can get data

* **Friday, October 30th, 9:17am** - Project due and presentations!  (Submission instructions will be posted later.)


## ACCESS TO INSTRUCTORS
We will schedule 1:1s throughout the week. We will also do mini lessons on certain topics if we notice that several people are running into the same issues.
