# Team Refactor Drill  

## Motivation (3 minutes) 

<!-- starts at 9:17 -->

In the real world, web developers often work on code that theyd didn't write originally. Today, we're goind to look at code that will be foreign to most of you and think about how to improve it -- code created by one of you!

## Volunteer Seeking (5 minutes) 

<!-- starts at 9:20 -->

Volunteer to have your code refactored by the class! Our volunteer will spend the drill time answering questions from other groups if necessary.

## Site Tour (10 minutes)  

<!-- starts at 9:25 -->

1. Fork and clone the developer's project so you have a local copy of the code to start from.

1. Start up the site in the browser.  (Make sure you have MongoDB running!)

1. Check out how the site works in the browser. Watch the Chrome Dev Tools console for client-side log messages and the Terminal for server-side log messages.

## Refactor Teams (20 minutes)  

<!-- starts at 9:35 -->

We'll divide into working groups of three people to look at six different parts of the code. **We do not expect you to implement all the changes you suggest**, but you should work with your team to plan how you would implement them and start if feasible.

<a href="foundation-back-end.md">FOUNDATION: BACK END</a>    
<a href="create-front-end.md" target="_blank">CREATE POSTS: FRONT END</a>   
<a href="create-back-end.md" target="_blank">CREATE POSTS: BACK END</a>  	
<a href="delete-front-end.md" target="_blank">DELETE POSTS: FRONT END</a>  
<a href="delete-back-end.md" target="_blank">DELETE POSTS: BACK END</a>  


We can also keep in mind some larger-scale considerations, like:  
	- Some refactoring decisions will affect multiple groups.   
	- Is the same code copied and pasted in many areas of the project? Could this be condensed into a helper function so that there's only one location to debug/update?   

	- Do the routes the client is sending requests to match the routes the server is prepared to respond on?  


## Group Refactor (25 min)  

<!-- starts at 9:55 -->

Let's come back together and walk through the code as a class, making some of the changes suggested by each group!
