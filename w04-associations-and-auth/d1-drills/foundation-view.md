# Foundation: View

1. In the browser, if we right click and "view source" we see HTML.  Where does this come from? What file(s) on our server that determines how the HTML looks, and how?

2. What determines the styling for the site? What outside CSS libraries or snippets are included? Where are the custom styles?  How are these connected to the HTML? 

3. What determines the front-end JavaScript for the site? What outside JavaScript libraries or files are included? What file has the custom JavaScript front-end code? 

4. How is the front-end JavaScript connected to the HTML? Are the script files included in the `<head>` or `<body>`? What are the advantages and disadvantages of doing it the way the developer chose to?

5. Which parts of the server code determine how the data will be displayed on the site's home page?

6. How would you refactor the front end HTML, CSS, and JS? Some specifics to watch out for:
	- Is the code organized in a sensible way?
	- Are variables named well, and is code indented in a way that is readable?
	- Are there comments that help you understand what each file or chunk of code is doing?
	- Did you find anything not working as intended?


7. Bonus: User experience is its own field of study, but developers can and should put some thought into it. (And we'll learn a more about it throughout the course.) 

	- If you were a new user approaching this site, would you know what it does? Could you find existing posts to read (if there are any)? Would you identify the new post form and/or delete buttons as things you could interact with?

	- Is the site's interface zany, fun, minimalistic, confusing? Share questions or constructive comments your group has about the experience of using the site.
