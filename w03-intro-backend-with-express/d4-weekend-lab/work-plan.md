# Sample Work Plan

It's hard to know how to approach a project of this size when you've only been working with some of these tools for a few days.

This sample work plan is intended to help you get started without going into every detail.

##Start the server.

Reference Lesson: <a href="https://github.com/sf-wdi-22-23/modules/tree/master/w03-intro-backend-with-express/d1-dawn-express-hello-world" target="_blank">Express Hello World</a>

1. Make a new directory and initialize your app inside it with `npm init`. Give it the entry point `server.js`. 

1. Use `npm install --save` to add express, ejs, body-parser, and mongoose.

1. Create your server file from the Terminal (`touch server.js`). At the top of your server.js file, require the express and body-parser modules to get started.  Use `express()` to create your `app` object.

1. At the bottom of your server.js file, use `app.listen` to set up your server to listen on a port. We usually use port 3000.

1. Run `node server.js`, `npm start`, or `nodemon` in the Terminal to start your server. If you gave `app.listen` a callback with a log message, you should see the log message in your Terminal. 

3. Go to localhost:3000/ to see another message that lets you know your server is listening (but a bit unhappy). In your server code, between the `require`s and the `app.listen`, start a section for routes!  Create a route to handle GET requests at the `/` path. Use a simple `res.send` to send a message that the route is working. Restart your server, reload the page, and you should see the message you sent as a response. Yay!

##Set up a git repo.

Reference: <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/" target="_blank">GitHub documentation</a>

1. In your Express project root directory, from the Terminal, run `git init`.  

2. On your GitHub account, create a new repo for this project. 

3. Copy the clone url from your new repository.

4. Back in your Terminal, run `git remote add origin YOUR_REPO'S_GITHUB_CLONE_URL`. Paste in your GitHub repo's clone url instead of `YOUR_REPO'S_GITHUB_CLONE_URL`.

1. Before you `git add .`, let's set it up so git will ignore our `node_modules` folder. Anyone who clones our project will be able to `npm install` to get all the dependencies installed just from our `package.json`, so there's no good reason to add all that to our repo.   In the Terminal, `touch .gitignore`.  Add a line to the `.gitignore` file that just says `node_modules`. (You can do this from the Terminal with `echo "node_modules" >> .gitignore`.)

1. Let's also run `npm init` again - it will remember all of our old answers, and it will automatically add our git repo to the `package.json`. Sweet!

5. Do our favorite sequence - `git add .`, `git commit -m "initial express server"`, and `git push origin master` to see that your code is up on GitHub. 


##Include your existing client-side code.

Reference Lesson: <a href="https://github.com/sf-wdi-22-23/modules/tree/master/w03-intro-backend-with-express/d1-dawn-express-hello-world" target="_blank">Express Hello World</a>

1. Create a folder called `views` in the root directory of your express app.  Make a copy of your `index.html` from Project 0, rename it `index.ejs`, and put it in the `views` folder. Use the `cp` command from the Terminal to copy the file. It might look a little like this: `cp ~/dev/proj-0/index.html  ./views/index.ejs`.  

1. In your server code, after your `require`s, start a section for config(uration)! Configure your app to use ejs as its view engine.

1. Update your app's `GET /` route to render index.ejs as its response. 

2. Create a folder called `public` in the root directory of your Express app.  Copy over the rest of the files and folders from your project 0 app, into the public folder. 

3. In your server code's config section, configure your app to serve the static assets from your `public` directory with `express.static`: `app.use(express.static('public'));`. This makes everything in public available on your client side just as if it were in the same directory as `index.html` (or in our case, `index.ejs`).

1. Restart your server and check out your page in the browser. If you copied your code exactly into your public folder, and used the `app.use` line above, your files will probably load correctly. But if you see an error in your console, it probably means `href` for the `<link>` for your css, or the `src` for your `<script>` for your js, needs to change in your `index.ejs`.

1. If you haven't yet, make a new git commit. Give it a descriptive commit message like `"include client-side microblog code"`.

Your client-side code should have a lot of the functionality requirements already, except that data isn't passed between the server and client.
    


##Modify the existing microblog code.

4. In your client-side JavaScript, check that you have an event handler for the new post form.  Add one if needed.  Also add an event handler for the delete buttons, if needed. For the delete buttons, use event delegation. That means: add the event listener to a DOM element higher in the DOM tree (like the document itself) and use a selector to filter down which DOM elements actually trigger the function (more info can be found in the <a href="http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events" target="_blank">jQuery `on` method documentation</a>).

1. Add a template to your `index.ejs` to display the posts. You can put it in the same `<ul>` as you're currently using to display displaying, if you'd like to keep the seed data around a little longer. In that case, both will show up until we remove the seed data.

1. Add an AJAX request to each event handler. Your requests should use a RESTful route (HTTP verb + path). The request for your new post form should send along the data required. See some examples from <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/#entry-examples" target="_blank"> the jQuery docs</a>.

1. The request for your delete buttons probably doesn't have an `id` to use yet, since the posts on the front end only microblog didn't need an id. Update your HTML template in `index.ejs` and any HTML strings that create new posts in your client-side JavaScript so that each post has its id stored with it in the HTML.

1. In the `success` method of your AJAX requests, just `console.log` the server's response for now.

1. If you haven't yet, make a new git commit. Give it a descriptive commit message.

##Add routes to the server.

Reference Reading: <a href="https://github.com/sf-wdi-22-23/modules/blob/master/w03-intro-backend-with-express/d1-homework.md" target="_blank"> RESTful routing</a>
 
1. Since your client-side event handlers are going to make AJAX requests, let's tell the server to expect those kinds of requests.  In the routes section of your server code, add skeletons for all of the RESTful routes listed in the requirements in the README. 

1. Don't fully fill in the function that says how the server should respond to each type of request, just start with a comment that says how the route *will* respond when you're done, and a `res.sendStatus(200)`. 

1. Make another new commit. 

##Move data to the database.

Reference Lesson: <a href="https://github.com/sf-wdi-22-23/modules/tree/master/w03-intro-backend-with-express/d4-dusk-mongoose" target="_blank">Mongoose</a>

Ok, honestly we could get by with all our database code in `server.js`. But, as our apps grow and get more complex, we'll want to make our code more modular. The examples we've seen, with `/models/index.js` and `models/foods.js` (etc.) are built to be really modular and work well as we grow.  We'll follow that format.

1. Create a `models` directory in the root directory of your Express project. Inside the `models` directory, create an `index.js` file. The `index.js` file should require mongoose and connect to your app's mongoose db.

1. Create a `post.js` file in the `models` directory. In the `post.js` file, set up a schema and a model for posts. Set `post.js`'s `module.exports` to be the Post model.

1. Modify `models/index.js` to have it incorporate your Post model.  It will need to:
    - require your model from the other file
    - add your model to `index.js`'s `module.exports`

1. Optional: Create a `seed.js` file. Move the seed data array from your client-side javascript code into the seed.js file. The seed.js file should remove all posts from the database, then create all the posts from your seed data again. It will need to require your models: `var db = require("./models")`.

1. This seems like a great time for a commit.

##Connect database to server routes.

Reference: <a href="https://github.com/sf-wdi-22-23/toEatly_mongoose" target="_blank">toEatly-mongoose</a>

1. In your server code, with the other `require`s, add one to bring in your database models: `var db = require("./models")`. When we `require` a whole folder, Node looks for an `index.js` in that folder and basically requires it.  So, requiring the models folder should make your post model (and any other models you eventually add) available on a `db` object. For example, the Post model is `db.Post`.

1. Modify your `GET '/'` route to  `console.log` all of the post data from the databse. (Make sure you have `mongod` running.) Since your browser automatically makes a get request when you visit a url, test this by going to `localhost:3000/` in your browser. Check the Terminal for your server-side console log.

1. Update your `GET '/'` route to render `index.ejs` with the data from your database. If you still have seed data in your client-side JavaScript file, go ahead and remove it now. Test your route in Postman again, then test it from the browser. 

1. Once that's working, make a new commit! Give it a descriptive message like "render data in index.ejs" or "kick ejs's butt".

1. Fill in the `POST '/api/posts'` skeleton API route you created earlier. Test it with Postman. 

1. One by one, fill in the other skeleton routes you created. **Test each route with Postman** before you try to request it from your client.

1. Make another new commit if you haven't yet.

##Use server responses on the client!

Reference: 

  * <a href="https://github.com/sf-wdi-22-23/toEatly" target="_blank">toEatly</a> (go to the sprint-three branch) for deleting data from the page with jQuery
  *  <a href="https://github.com/sf-wdi-22-23/modules/tree/master/w02-working-with-objects/d3-dusk-ajax" target="_blank">Giphy lab</a> for adding data to the page with jQuery and HTML strings

At this point, the server should be sending the data you need, but if you're following the instructions in order, you're just logging those reponses to the console in the browser.

1. Modify the code in your new post form submit event handler so that it takes the server's response and uses it to add a new post to the page with jQuery and HTML strings.

1. Reminder: make a new commit.

1. Modify the code in your delete button click event handler so that it uses jQuery to delete the post from the page once it successfully gets the server's response. 

1. Make a new commit.
