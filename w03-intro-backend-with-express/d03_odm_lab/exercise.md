# Mini-Mongoose: Building your own ODM

## Overview

In this exercise you will be implementing your own version of Mongoose in order to understand how an object-document-mapper (ODM) works under the hood. This exercise will consist of building a constructor function and adding several functions that mimic Mongoose's functionality to the constructor's prototype.

### Base Challenges
- In your dev folder, or your week 3 subfolder, create a js document, mini_mongoose.js
- This is where you will be writing all of your code for this exercise. 

**Create an object constructor called Model**

  1.  Define a function called Model. The model will have these properties:
      - a parameter called `name`
      - a property `type` that is assigned the parameter `name`
      - an empty array named data
      - an identification number `_id` assigned to 0.
  2. Create a function called `returnThis` which takes a parameter `object`. Have the callback return the passed-in object.

 ```js
   // constructor function with name parameter
   function Model(name) {
     // property 'type' assigned to parameter 'name'
     this.type = name;
     // property 'data' assigned to empty array
     this.data = [];
     // property '_id' assigned to 0
     this._id = 0;
   }

   console.log(Model); // [Function: Model]
   console.log(Model.prototype); // {}

   // callback function we can use to return an object
   // this is similar to how Mongoose operates
   function returnThis(object) {
     return object;
   }
   ```

**Add a create method to the Model's prototype:**

  1. Define a `create` function as a property on the Model's prototype which accepts the parameters `objectProperties` and `callbackFunction`. The `objectProperties` is the Javascript object literal that will be used to build the new instance of `Model` and `callbackFunction` is a function that will be called later.
  2. Defines a variable `objectContainer` that has an empty object assigned to it.  This object will house your passed-in object as well as other meta-data we will generate.
  3. Give `objectContainer` a property `_id` and assign to it our Model's `_id` incremented by 1.
  4. Assign the `objectContainer`'s `subData` property to the `configObj`.
  5. Give our `objectContainer` a `timeStamp` property with the current date assigned to it. *Hint: use the Date constructor*
  6. Push our `objectContainer` into our Model.data array.
  7. Lastly this function returns our callback. Our callback should simply return any object passed-in as an argument.

    ```js
    // add create function as property to Model prototype, passing a properties object (to specify the details of the Model being created) and a callback function

    Model.prototype.create = function(objectProperties, callbackFunction) {
      // assign a variable objectContainer to an empty object

      // define a subData property on objectContainer and assign the passed in objectProperties object to it

      // increment the Model instance's '_id' property by 1

      // define a property of '_id' on objectContainer, assign value of objectProperties's '_id' property

      // define the timestamp property of the objectContainer, assign it to

      // add the objectContainer to our the Model instance's data array

      // return the invoked callback with the objectContainer as a parameter
    }
    ```
  6. You should be able to add the following code to your js document and "Seed" your model:
  
  ```
    [
      {first_name: "Mister", last_name: "Robot"},
      {first_name: "Stanley", last_name: "Steemer"},
      {first_name: "Action", last_name: "Bronson"},
      {first_name: "Jillian", last_name: "Murphy"},
      {first_name: "Nichole", last_name: "DeJarden"}
    ].forEach( function(person) {
      user.create(person, function(person){
        return person;
      });
    });

  ```
  
**Add a `findById` method to the Model's prototype:**

  1. Define a `findById()` function as a property on the Model's prototype which accepts the parameters `objectId` (an integer) and `callback` (a function to be called later).
  2. Iterate over the Model's `data` array for a matching object that has the same `objectId`.
  3. Return the matching object using the passed-in callback.
    <br><br>

    ```js
    // define function as property 'findById' on Model prototype, passing objectId (an integer), and a callback function
    Model.prototype.findById = function(objectId, callback) {
      // iterate over data array of Model instance

      // if the current object being iterated over has an _id matching the objectId

      // return the matching result using the callback function
    }
    ```

**Add a where method like (what we made in drills yesterday):**
  1. Define a function `where()` that accepts a parameter 'properties', that looks will look like this: `{last_name: "Ever", first_name: "Greatest"}`
  2. `where()` should also accept a parameter `callback`, which will be a function.
  3. Iterate over `this.data` (the array referenced by Model's data property). *Note: We are doing this instead of passing in an array*
  4. Return an array of objects that match the passed-in properties to a callback like this: `return callback(output)`
  <br><br>

  ```js
  // define function as property 'where' on Model prototype, passing properties
  Model.prototype.where = function(properties) {
    // iterate over array of Model instance data property

    // compare the value of the property of the object that is being iterated over
    // with the value of that same property from the properties object
    // add matching objects to a collection

    // return matching objects using callback function
  }
  ```

**Add a destroy method to the Model's prototype:**

  1. Define a `destroy()` function as a property on the Model's prototype which takes the parameters `objectId`, and `callback`.
  2. Iterate over the Model's `data` array for a matching object that has the same `objectId`.
  3. Remove the matching object from the Model `data` array.
  4. Return the matching object within a callback call.
  <br><br>

    ```js
    Model.prototype.delete: function(objectId, callback) {
        // set position and marked variables for later use

        // iterate over the array of the Model instance's data property

        // if the current object being iterated over has an '_id' equal to the objectId

        // set marked to the object and position to the index

        // splice one item from the array at the index of position

        // return marked object using callback
    }
    ```
    
**Before you proceed to the Stretch Challenges**

1. If you haven't already, take a look at the solutions for what you have completed. 
2. Check out the "Driver Code" at the bottom. This code will run a few of your functions and see if they are working properly. 
3. Paste the Driver Code into the bottom of your JS document, and run your document in the node REPL by running `node mini_mongoose.js' in your terminal
4. Make adjustments if it isn't running as expected. 

###Stretch Challenges

**Add a update method to the Model's prototype:**

1. Define an `update()` function as a property on the Model's prototype which accepts the parameters `objectId`, `updateObject`, and `callback`
2. Iterate over the Model's `data` array for a matching object that has the same `objectId`.
3. Update the matching object's subData property by assigning it to the passed-in `updateObject`.
4. Return the matching object within a callback call.
<br><br>

  ```js
    // define function as property 'update' on Model prototype, passing objectId (an integer, and a callback function)
    Model.prototype.update = function(objectId, updateObject, callback) {
      // iterate over data array of Model instance

      // if the object currently being iterated over has an '_id' that matches the objectId

      // set that object's subData property to the updateObject

      // return the updated objectContainer using callback function
    }
 ```
